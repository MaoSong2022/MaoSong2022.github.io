Hi, my name is Mao Song (毛松). I am currently a researcher in [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) or Shanghai AI Lab. I am working on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and their applications.

Before joining Shanghai AI Lab, I received my Master's degree from ShanghaiTech University, under the supervision of [Hao Wang](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/wanghao1/main.htm) and Bachelor's degree from Beijing Institute of Technology.

Though I am working on MLLMs, I am also interested in other topics, such as large language models, reasoning models and math-related topics.

If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me. My email is [maosong AT pjlab.org.cn](mailto:maosong@pjlab.org.cn).

Occasionally, I will upload some of my learning videos on [Bilibili](https://b23.tv/a0Bb9Z1), feel free to check it out and leave comments.
